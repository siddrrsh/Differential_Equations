% my functions are accurate to 5 decimal places % I already resubmitted my previous homework% COMPARISON COMMENTS: The Taylor series needs a minimum of 10 terms to be accurate to 1 decimal, minimum of 100 to be accurate to 2 decimals, etc.% We can express the relationshop between accuracy and terms as minimum 10^n terms to be accurate to n decimal places% The difference between in-built functions and the taylor series is miniscule in terms of accuracy but the taylor series is much slower% COSINE% my cosine at x = 1% time is: 0.915213 seconds.ticmycos(1);toc% built-in cosine at x = 1% time is: 3.31402e-05 secondsticcos(1)toc;% SIN% my sin at x = 1% time is: 0.894104 secondsticmysin(1);toc% built-in sin at x = 1% time is: 3.50475e-05 secondsticsin(1)toc;% E^x% my e^x at x = 1% time is: 0.85143 secondsticmye(1);toc% built-in e^x at x = 1% time is: 3.31402e-05 seconds.tice^(1)toc;
